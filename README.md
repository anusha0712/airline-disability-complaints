# Disability Related Complaints Against U.S Carriers (2019-2023)

## Introduction

Hello! My name is Anusha Subramanian and I'm a Data Journalist at Columbia Journalism School. I'm primarily interested in anything that provides critical commentary on the human condition and specifically interested in public health, culture with a South Asian focus, books, poetry and lots and lots of food. You can find my work [here](https://anusha0712.github.io) and this project's completed story [here](https://anusha0712.github.io/airline_disability_complaints/).

For this project, I wanted to visualize the disability related complaints that passengers made against airlines. The original data comes from pdfs released by the Department of Transportation. Those can be accessed [here](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/annual-report-disability-related-air-travel-complaints).

## Goals

The goal of this project was to incorporate responsive design into our data stories and familiarize ourselves with ai2html. 

I compiled the Department of Transportation's PDF reports from 2019-2023 into CSVs which are available in the repository to help with the data analysis.

## Frameworks Used

**Code**
- Python (pandas)
- R (plotting)
- HTML 
- ai2html
- Excel

**Data Visualization**
- [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de)
- Adobe Illustrator
- `ggplot2` in R
- ai2html



## Methodology 

Here is the framework that I followed for my analysis. The code notebook contains more detailed commentary for the individual steps.

1. Create CSVs of summary data, categories of disability-related complaints and complaints per airline over the years.

2. There are 11 airlines used in this analysis and those were chosen for being the largest U.S commercial carriers by market share (information from Bureau of Transport Statistics)

3. Compiled the number of flights per airline and the number of enplaned passengers per year to my existing data from the PDFs. This was also gathered from Bureau of Transport Statistics.

4. Calculated the rate of disability related complaints per million passengers for each airline and each year. Just using raw complaints would be misleading because over the years, airlines have carried different number of passengers and operated different number of flights. We have to be sure that the number of complaints going up is not just because number of passengers and flights are going up too.


## Limitations - "Wants" vs "Needs"

Because of the short time constraint for this project, my entire focus was on the correct analysis of data and using ai2html in creating a responsive webpage. 

I believe I achieved my goals but given time, I would have loved to delve into the Air Traffic Consumer reports that list other complaints and reports against airlines per month to supplement my analysis of these disability complaints. For example, the ATC reports also have data on how many times wheelchairs and other accessibility related baggage was mishandled or delayed, causing pain and difficulty to individuals who needed those services. 


## Note on AI use

Claude AI was used for some HTML purposes like designing the header and color palette of the site.
